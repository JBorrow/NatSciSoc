				<h1>My department is being annoying! Help!</h1>
				<p>If a department is giving you trouble, ignoring you or won't
				let you do one of their modules without a good reason, contact
				us. We're here to help you! An e-mail from us has a lot more
				weighting than you fighting on your own. We are also able to put
				you in contact with others who could be able to help if we are
				unsucessful.</p>
				
				<h1>Mentor scheme for science students</h1>
				<p>If you would like some advice about modules from someone who
				has actually studied them, then we as a society are here for
				you. Contact us at <a href='mai&#108;t&#111;&#58;na%&#55;4&#46;s%63i&#46;so%63&#64;d&#117;rham&#46;a%&#54;3&#46;u&#107;'>nat&#46;s&#99;i&#46;&#115;oc&#64;dur&#104;am&#46;ac&#46;uk</a>,
				letting us know what modules you would like advice about. We
				will then put you in contact with someone in a higher year who
				has done that module. If you're wanting to give this support to
				people in the lower years, please contact us!</p>
				
				<h1>Anything else!</h1>
				<p>If you are thinking about applying to Durham to do Natural
				Sciences and would like to chat to someone aout what the course
				is like, then please feel free to contact us. If there's
				anything else that you think we could help with (e.g. setting
				up a new science based event) then drop us an e-mail or Facebook
				message. We really are here to help!
