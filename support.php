				<h1>My department is being annoying! Help!</h1>
				<p>If a department is giving you trouble, ignoring you or won't
				let you do one of their modules without a good reason, contact
				us. We're here to help you! An e-mail from us has a lot more
				weighting than you fighting on your own. We are also able to put
				you in contact with others who could be able to help if we are
				unsucessful.</p>
				<h1>Mentor Scheme for Science Students</h1>
				<p>If you would like some advice about modules from someone who
				has actually studied them, then we as a society are here for
				you. Contact us at <a href='mai&#108;t&#111;&#58;na%&#55;4&#46;s%63i&#46;so%63&#64;d&#117;rham&#46;a%&#54;3&#46;u&#107;'>nat&#46;s&#99;i&#46;&#115;oc&#64;dur&#104;am&#46;ac&#46;uk</a>,
				letting us know what modules you would like advice about. We
				will then put you in contact with someone in a higher year who
				has done that module. If you're wanting to give this support to
				people in the lower years, please contact us!</p>
