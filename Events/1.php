<h2> 15th September 2014 </h2>

<p>We would like to extend a warm welcome to all of the freshers joining Durham
in October. We are sure that you will have a great time during freshers' week
and beyond! Good luck trying to stave off fresher's flu - according to the BBC
<a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/hub/A645211">more than 90% of new students
get it</a>. I'd recommend stocking up on cold and flu remedies as soon as you
can!</p>

<p>If you're having any trouble choosing modules, or are unsure if you have made
the correct choice and want to speak to someone in a similar position to you,
don't forget that you can always e-mail us at any time on any matter at
<a href='mailto&#58;n&#97;t&#46;sc%6&#57;&#46;soc%4&#48;du%72&#37;&#54;8am%2Ea&#37;6&#51;&#46;u%6B'>nat&#46;sci&#46;&#115;oc&#64;d&#117;rha&#109;&#46;&#97;c&#46;u&#107;</a>.</p>

<p>Have a fantastic time - you'll miss it when lectures start. Good luck in your
first year and we'll see you at the freshers' fair!</p>
