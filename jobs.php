				<h2>What is Teach First?</h2>

				<p>It is a UK charity offering graduates the opportunity to teach, inspire and change the lives of students in challenging circumstances. Their goal is to create future leaders who can raise pupil’s achievement levels and help break the link between low family income and poor educational attainment. Teach First are sponsored by many Times Top 100 Graduate Employers including Accenture, McKinsey, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Credit Suisse and Google, who actively recruit graduates who have completed the Teach First scheme.</p>
			
				<h2>What is the Leadership Development Scheme?</h2>
<p>After intensive training, the prestigious 2-year scheme is spent teaching in a disadvantaged school where you take on real responsibility from day one. You will train for a fully funded PGCE and become a ‘newly qualified teacher’ in your second year, enjoying a salary increase of £4k. The scheme also lets you complete a summer internship with one of their sponsor companies which frequently leads to a graduate role at the end of the scheme.</p>
