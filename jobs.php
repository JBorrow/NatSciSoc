				<h2>What is Teach First?</h2>

				<p>It is a UK charity offering graduates the opportunity to teach, inspire and change the lives of students in challenging circumstances. Their goal is to create future leaders who can raise pupil’s achievement levels and help break the link between low family income and poor educational attainment. Teach First are sponsored by many Times Top 100 Graduate Employers, including Accenture, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Credit Suisse and Google, who look to recruit graduates who have completed the Teach First scheme.</p>
			
				<h2>What is the Leadership Development Scheme?</h2>

				<p>After intensive training, the prestigious 2-year scheme is spent teaching in a disadvantaged school and you take on proper responsibility from day one. You will train for a PGCE, become a ‘newly qualified teacher’ in your second year and enjoy a salary increase.</p>
				<p>The scheme also lets you complete a summer internship with one of their sponsor companies. These internships frequently lead to graduate job offers at the end of the scheme as many employers look to hire Teach First graduates. Remember joining Teach First doesn’t commit you to become a teacher after 2 years. This scheme is about changing children’s lives whilst dramatically improving your own leadership and employability skills.</p>

				<h2>Is this for you?</h2>
				<p> Are you a STEM student?</p>
				<p>Would you like to teach Maths, Science, Computer Science, ICT or Design?</p>
				<p><b>If so, please apply here <a href="http://bit.ly/1qKuZuf">http://bit.ly/1qKuZuf</a></b></p>
				<p>You <b>do not</b> need to have any teaching experience.</p>

				<p>After applying, Teach First will be in touch to help you start your application, but you must apply to us first. This is a free service.</p>
